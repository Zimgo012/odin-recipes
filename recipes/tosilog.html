            <p>Tosilog is a popular Filipino breakfast meal. 
                The name tosilog was derived from the different components of the meal 
                which are: Tocino (cured pork), Sinangag (Filipino garlic fried rice), 
                and Sunny-side up egg. Tosilog is best eaten with a spicy vinegar dip.</p>
            
                    <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <li>1 lb. uncooked tocino</li>
                        <li>3 cups sinangag</li>
                        <li>3 sunny-side up eggs</li>
                        <li>2 cups water</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup cooking oil</li>

                     </ul>

                     <ol><h3>Steps</h3>
                        <li>Boil the water in a cooking pot.</li>
                        <li>Once the water starts to boil, pour-in the cooking oil and add the uncooked tocino. Boil in medium heat until the water evaporates.</li>
                        <li>Once the water completely evaporate, the oil will be left behind. Let one side of the tocino cook in oil for 3 minutes. Flip the tocino and cook the other side for the same time.</li>
                        <li>Arrange the cooked tocino with the eggs in individual plates.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, remove the excess oil in the cooking pot where the tocino was cooked. Heat the same pot and put-in the sinangag. Cook the fried rice for 1 minute while tossing. The residue from the tocino will stick to the fried rice making it more tasty.</li>
                        <li>Arrange the fried rice with the tocino in individual plates.</li>
                        <li>Serve with spiced vinegar.</li>
                        <li>Share and enjoy!</li>
